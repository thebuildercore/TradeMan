# 💼 TradeMan – The Ground-Level Stock Market

TradeMan is a ground-level stock market where cafés, shops, and local businesses raise capital by offering partial ownership directly to investors.
It’s not just another Web3 DeFi app — it’s a revolution in local investing, built to empower tier-2 economies that form the backbone of the Indian economy.

📍 **Think of it as investing in the real economy — right from your street.

🚨 **The Problem**

Small businesses power our communities but struggle to scale due to lack of flexible funding.
Traditional loans are rigid. Crowdfunding is chaotic. VCs don’t look down this far.
At the same time, traders and investors want real-world ROI and community-driven assets.

🧠** The Solution: TradeMan**

TradeMan lets trusted businesses tokenize a portion of their ownership (less than 100% to prevent small business to loss there ownership) and raise funds from local or global investors.
🪙 These tokens represent:
           
           📈 Equity-like ownership
           💰 Real profit-sharing (dividends)
           🔒 Transparent smart contracts

⚙️ **How It Works**

    Business creates listing                – defines % of ownership to tokenize (e.g., 60%)
    Smart contract deployed                 – tokens minted and locked with cap rules
    Investors buy tokens                    – tracked on-chain via MetaMask or wallet
    Business grows                          – shares profit via dividend payout
    Investors earn                          – passive income, and trade their shares
