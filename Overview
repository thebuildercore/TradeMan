           💰 Real profit-sharing (dividends)
           🔒 Transparent smart contracts

⚙️ How It Works
Business creates listing                – defines % of ownership to tokenize (e.g., 60%)
Smart contract deployed                 – tokens minted and locked with cap rules
Investors buy tokens                    – tracked on-chain via MetaMask or wallet
Business grows                          – shares profit via dividend payout
Investors earn                          – passive income, and trade their shares
