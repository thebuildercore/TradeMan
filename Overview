# 💼 TradeMan – The Ground-Level Stock Market
TradeMan is not just another Web3 app — it's a revolution in local investing.
A ground-level stock market where cafés, shops, and local businesses raise capital by offering partial ownership directly to investors.

📍 Think of it as investing in the real economy — right from your street.

🚨 The Problem
Small businesses power our communities but struggle to scale due to lack of flexible funding.
Traditional loans are rigid. Crowdfunding is chaotic. VCs don’t look down this far.
At the same time, traders and investors want real-world ROI and community-driven assets.
